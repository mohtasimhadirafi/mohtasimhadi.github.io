			"I am an Analytics Engineer with a passion for leveraging data-driven insights to drive business growth. Currently, I work at Intelligent Machines Limited in Dhaka, Bangladesh, where I have developed an analytic module and data pipeline for bank statement and CIB analysis, empowering bankers with valuable transaction behavior metrics. Additionally, I collaborated with a diverse team to build a recommendation engine for a multinational company, optimizing marketing strategies based on sales data. I hold a BSc Engg. in Software Engineering from the Islamic University of Technology, with a strong foundation in design patterns, server programming, and software design. My recent thesis focused on an efficient deep learning-based approach for recognizing agricultural pests, demonstrating my ability to develop robust pipelines using ensemble methods. I am proficient in Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, and R, and have expertise in technologies such as Pandas, Django, React, and Firebase. With certifications in Google Data Analytics and a range of skills in version control, databases, and data visualization, I am equipped to tackle complex analytical challenges. Beyond work, I enjoy reading and writing literature, exploring new destinations through solo travel, and playing musical instruments. I am fluent in both English and Bangla.",
